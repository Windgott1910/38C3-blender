# 38C3-blender
An explained version of the simplified version of the blender file that came with the 38c3 Styleguide
(I felt that the simplified one lacked a bit of explaining for total beginners, so I added some)

All credit for the original file goes to the 38C3 team and to yvmqznrm for creating the geonodes, I just put some text beside it.

To open this file you need do download Blender on <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/">the official Blender Website</a> and once you downloaded it, it should land you on the Layout View.
The default camera position should already include the text I added to explain how the file works and where to modify things :)

The simplified version by yvmqznrm is blob_simplified.blend, my modified version is blob_simplified_explained.blend.

# Here is the text again separately in case you deleted it or something:

<i>original simplified .blend file from: 
https://github.com/yvmqznrm/38C3-blender/tree/main

Modify your Vector image in such a 
way that only one face / area remains.
Import it via File -> Import -> Scalable
Vector Graphics (.svg).

Convert the Vector image to a mesh:
(next to "Object Mode") Object -> Convert
-> Mesh.

Now press TAB, A, X -> Dissolve Faces,
X -> Only Faces.
Your Vector image is now imported.

Select the type of blob you DON'T want
to have and press H, this hides it.

Now select the type of blob you want
and and find the Node Object Info in
the black square labled Source Geometry
and change the second entry from the
bottom from Source Geometry to your
imported and converted Vector image.

Your are now ready to press SPACE :)

You can delete this text by selecting
it and pressing X and then Delete.
You can edit / copy this text by 
selecting it and pressing TAB.

The default colours are Coral Red
for the lines and Dark Aubergine
for the filled blobs.

Preview by holding Z + pressing
Num 8, render with the Render
button at the top left

Enjoy the blobs :)</i>
